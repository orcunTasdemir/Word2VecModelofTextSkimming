# A Word2Vec Semantic Assosications Model for Skimming Behaviour
## My paper --> [SkimmingBehaviorOrcun](/Final%20Submission%20Orcun%20Tasdemir.pdf)

The <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/">Word2Vec model</a> uses the skip-gram architecture to create a 300 dimensional distributed representation of words trained on the Google News Dataset. In this project, I have used this model, and also word frequency of use datasets from <a href="https://anc.org/">Open American National Corpus</a>, to develop an algorithm that predicts what sentences are worth reading and what sentences are skippable with reasonable risk of missing out on information. The aim was to simulate/ re-create the skimming behavior we humans indulge in and to develop a model that people can use to extract the most amount of information they can from a text given a small time window not enough to read the entire text.
